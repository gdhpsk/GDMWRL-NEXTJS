			<h2> How it works </h2>

			âž¢ Submitted records are accepted when a player beats a level or reaches the minimum requirements of the correspondent level.
			<br></br>
âž¢ The minimum requirement for each level corresponds to a higher % than the current record.
<br></br>
âž¢ If a level doesn&#39;t have any records, the minimum requirement for the World Record is at least 10%.
<br></br>
âž¢ Only runs from 0% are acceptable as official World Records.
<br></br>
âž¢ Only rated levels in-game are accepted into this list due to obvious reasons, but of course there are some exceptions (Read further).

<h2> Website Organization </h2>

âž¢ The website is organized into three different categories.
<br></br>
âž¢ The <Link href="/">Main List</Link> consists of the same content as <a href="https://www.pointercrate.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pointercrate&#39;s Demonlist</a>, the top #1 - #75 hardest Extreme Demons.
<br></br>
âž¢ The same configuration goes to the <Link href="/extended">Extended List</Link>, including the top #76- #150 from <a href="https://www.pointercrate.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pointercrate&#39;s Demonlist.</a>
<br></br>
âž¢ The <Link href="/legacy">Extra List</Link> consists of all the remaining Extreme Demons rated in-game and demons that are Mobile-List-worthy, organized in alphabetical order.
<br></br>
âž¢ Inside the <Link href="/legacy">Extra List</Link> there is a second category, which is the Past Rated Extreme Demons. These include the levels that were Extreme Demons but got unrated/updated exclusively. Any levels here must be Extreme Demon worthy to be on there.
<br></br>
âž¢ Each level has its own position and has the credit for the creators and verifier. Positioning doesn&#39;t apply to the Extra List however.
<br></br>
âž¢ Here is how a levelcard layout would look like: 
<p></p>
<Level
 n={1}
 name={"Name"}
 ytcode={"oh0FyZHZST8"}
 creator={"Creators"}
 records={[{"name":"Name","percent":["video","screenshot/clip"],"screenshot":false,"link":"https://youtube.com","hertz":"0","_id":"63c0b32328158a91b338558f"}]}
 verifier={"Verifier"}
></Level>
  <br></br><br></br>
<h2> World Records Organization </h2>

âž¢ World Records are categorized differently depending on the Hz that the player used to achieve it.
<br></br>
âž¢ Only World Records with videos attached are official World Records for the correspondent level.
<br></br>
âž¢ For all leaderboard catagories, if there is a screenshot record, it will go in the &quot;Screenshot Records/Completions&quot; category, and there are no exceptions to this.

<h2> Submission Rules </h2>

âž¢ Check the submission form <a href="https://forms.gle/2UhMp8ravaBKCjpm8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here! </a>
<br></br>
âž¢ Official records must include a video. The most preferred platforms are Youtube, Twitch and other video sharing/streaming platforms. It is also extremely encouraged for you to upload full videos.
<br></br>
âž¢ Screenshot submissions are also allowed and will be credited, but are considered as unofficial records, so no points are awarded. Screenshots must also be inside the level, otherwise they won&#39;t be added.
<br></br>
âž¢ For better chances of getting your record accepted, it is recommended you provide the following to prove your legitimacy:
<p></p>
- Taps (Sound or &quot;circle taps&quot; shown on screen)
<br></br>
- Raw Footage (Full recording)
<br></br>
- Liveplay (External recording of your device&#39;s screen)
<p></p>
âž¢ Submissions with Liveplay are instantly accepted onto the list.
<br></br>
âž¢ Other ways of showing your legitimacy are possible, but for common sense, those won&#39;t be listed here.

<h2>Points System & Ranking </h2>

âž¢ The amount of World Records you have is correspondent to the amount of points you have. Each World Record you hold gives you a point. If you have multiple records on one level (i.e. different refresh rate), only your highest % record will award you points.
<br></br>
âž¢ Each level you beat as first victor gives you two points instead of one.
<br></br>
âž¢ Extra List Records work differently than Main List and Extended List Records. Extra List don&#39;t award points, unless it&#39;s a completion, in which awards one point only.
<br></br>
âž¢ When a new World Record is accepted, the point is transferred from the old World Record holder to the new one.
<br></br>
{"âž¢ HRR (High Refresh Rates) records are only accepted if higher/tied with the current LRR (Low Refresh Rate / <= 60hz) World Record."}
<br></br>
âž¢ Unofficial World Record holders won&#39;t be given any points for it. Only Official World Records are worthy points.
<br></br>
âž¢ (Discord Server) The Discord server awards special roles for World Record holders currently having three of them.                                                                                   
<br></br>
âž¢ (Discord Server) If you hold 1 WRs, you&#39;ll be given the WR Holder role. The same applies for 5 WRs, however you&#39;ll also be given the WR Pioneer role. If you hold 10 WRs, you&#39;ll finally earn the WR Master role.
<br></br>
âž¢ (Discord Server) The &#39;ðŸ‘‘ #1 Stats Viewer&#39; role is given to the one that is #1 on the Mobile World Records stats viewer, giving exclusive chatting perms.
